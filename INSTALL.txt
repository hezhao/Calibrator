3D SCANNING SOFTWARE BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

The software requires Qt and OpencV libraries. It should run on any system that 
satisfies those requirements. It has been developed and tested using Qt 4.8.4 
and OpencV 2.4.3 in Microsoft Windows 7. It has also been tried in Mac OS X and 
while it builds and runs fine no extensive testing has been done on this platform.

Feel free to modify the paths on top of 'build/scan3d-capture.pro'.

Extract/Install to C:\opencv\opencv-2.4.3
Add C:\opencv\opencv-2.4.3\opencv\build\x86\vc10\bin to PATH

3) Build scanning software

cd scan3d-capture/build
qmake
nmake release


---- GNU/Linux Debian Jessie (V4L2) ----

1) Install Qt and libraries (from packages)

sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev libv4l-dev

2) Install OpenCV 2.4.3 (from source)

mkdir ~/opencv && cd ~/opencv
wget -c -O OpenCV-2.4.3.tar.bz2 http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-unix/2.4.3/OpenCV-2.4.3.tar.bz2
tar xjf OpenCV-2.4.3.tar.bz2
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../OpenCV-2.4.3
make && sudo make install

3) Build scanning software

cd scan3d-capture/build
qmake
make


---- Mac OS X Mountain Lion (MacPorts) ----

1) Install Qt

sudo port install qt4-mac

2) Install OpenCV

sudo port install opencv

3) Build scanning software

On some systems you may need to install git prior to 'brew update':

brew install git

Run and fix any problem found:

brew doctor

1) Install Qt

brew install qt

2) Install opencv

brew install opencv

3) Use either 10.6 or 10.9 for QMAKE_MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET in build/scan3d-capture.pro

4) Build scanning software

cd scan3d-capture/build
qmake
make
